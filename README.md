React+Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Setup
Install Node.js and npm
Run command
- npm i --legacy-peer-deps
- npm run build (host on server)
- npm run dev (host locally)

# Legacy Issues
Timeline uses module which requires older version of react which is still supported so the error can be ignored
If you want to remove the error create a branch and ask to commit.
