Government Side (Proposition): Supports the motion.
Opening Government (OG): Prime Minister (PM), Deputy Prime Minister (DPM)
Closing Government (CG): Government Member (GM), Government Whip (GW)
Opposition Side: Opposes the motion.
Opening Opposition (OO): Leader of Opposition (LO), Deputy Leader of Opposition (DLO)
Closing Opposition (CO): Opposition Member (OM), Opposition Whip (OW)
Speeches:

Each speaker delivers a 7-minute speech.
The first and last minute of each speech is protected, meaning no points of information (POIs) can be offered.
Between the second and sixth minutes, opponents can raise POIs, brief questions or comments that the speaker can choose to accept or decline.
Speaking Roles and Responsibilities:
Opening Government (OG):

Prime Minister (PM): Defines the motion, introduces the government case, and outlines arguments in support of the motion.
Deputy Prime Minister (DPM): Rebuilds and extends the case for the government while refuting points made by the opposition.
Opening Opposition (OO):

Leader of Opposition (LO): Responds to the PM's case, refutes government arguments, and presents the opposition's stance.
Deputy Leader of Opposition (DLO): Extends opposition's case, rebuts DPM, and solidifies opposition arguments.
Closing Government (CG):

Government Member (GM): Presents a new argument or “extension” for the government side, building on the opening government’s case.
Government Whip (GW): Summarizes the entire debate from the government's perspective, refuting the opposition and not introducing new arguments.
