  "about": "This is *8Bit*\u2019s take on *Sands of time*, a cryptic game originally from Minecraft Championships. Teams enter their own dungeons and compete against the clock to collect as much hidden gold as they can. Keeping the timer topped up with sand is the only way for you to stay in the game. If you ~die~ unalive, your team must sacrifice resources to revive you. Bank your gold by offering it to the sphinx for a fee, or keep every coin by leaving the dungeon. However, if you leave, you can\u2019t return. So, in our version of this game we have QR codes stuck around our campus which when scanned can give either sand, gold or vault/vault key. Vaults contain enormously high amounts of gold but are harder to find as well. Be the team with the most gold when the sand runs out, and win some _golden_ prizes.",
